Search behavior continues to splinter across SERP types, AI overviews, and zero-click experiences. Winning teams embrace an experimentation mindset: publish fast, measure early, and prune content debt aggressively. You can no longer afford to ship keywords once per quarter and hope they perform.

Start with the outcome you need, whether that’s demand capture, brand impression, or consideration, and build cluster briefs around that intent. Pair each brief with structured data, media assets, and a promotion plan so the campaign has momentum the moment it goes live.
