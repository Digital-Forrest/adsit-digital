Ad marketplaces will always rebalance in favor of the highest bidder. The only guardrail is to anchor spend against forecasted pipeline, not historic click-through rates. That requires finance, rev-ops, and growth marketing to share the same dataset in near real time.

Spin up a rolling budget model that updates whenever lead flow or conversion efficiency changes. When CPMs spike, re-evaluate each channel using updated cost-per-opportunity targets and shift spend toward the best-performing routes.
